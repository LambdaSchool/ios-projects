# Preparing for Day 1 of Lambda School's iOS Curriculum

Here's an overview of material you should have mastered by day 1 of the iOS program. Feel free to skip any material you already know or you already covered in Lambda's "Intro to iOS" course.

Make sure you don't skimp on the command line and version control material. You'll need all these skills right from the start but these two in particular are fundamental to working through daily challenges.

## Preparing Equipment

Your computer should be ready to begin development on day one:

* Your Mac should be running the latest operating system.
* Establish an Apple ID. Visit http://appleid.apple.com.
* Install and run the latest version of Xcode. Visit https://developer.apple.com/download/. Make sure to run Xcode, confirm that it works, and allow it to install supplemental command line tools.
* Confirm that Xcode has installed `git`: open a terminal window (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and entering `git --version` at the command line. You should be running git version 2.18 or later.
* Test the simulator: create a new empty project, compile, and run it.
* Create a free GitHub account. Visit github.com. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDJAwTEO8)
* Set up your git identity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5flh0sRGBU) and global ignore file on your computer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fzNSluYjNM). 

## Cross Platform Skills

Train your essential cross-platform skills: Command line, Version control, Markdown, and Being your own expert. 

### Command Line

The text-based command line is a common platform for most development environments. Learning how to use this text-based interface enables you to interact directly with your computer's file system and access many developer-facing tools. Lambda's track focuses on the bash shell.

## Version Control 

Version control manages the distributed development of software, enabling collaboration, safe feature development, and snapshotted backups. Lambda's track uses the git revision control system and GitHub.com hosting.

* **Understand and explain the goals of version control** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKmW0oe_aEU&t=0s
* **Create a project starting at GitHub** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txRu0pWqR_c
* **Connect an existing project to GitHub** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ytcVKsSB0
* **Fork and contribute to a project** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggP3jBpWZwQ
* **Create good commits** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jO9BUQUcsY

## Markdown

Markdown defines a plain-text format used across the industry for writing rich text documents. Lambda's track uses the Common Mark standard from commonmark.org.

## Being Your Own Expert

New developers often ask for help, mostly for technical issues, and often for material they are already capable of finding on their own. Finding your own answers and helping yourself is a skill set that nutures your own capabilities. Building these competencies involves insight into understanding what you've already tried, good search skills, and the ability to meticulously self-inspect. Problem solving isn't a human quality one is born with, it is a skill set that is nutured and grown.
